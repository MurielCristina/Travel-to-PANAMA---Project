          <h3>Why Panama?</h3>
          <h2>
            Panama<br /><small
              >Center of the world, heart of the universe.</small

          <p>
            Legend has it that Panama City was founded by the Spanish
            conquistadors who saw its potential as a strategic hub for trade and
            exploration. Much like other historic capitals, Panama City started
            as a modest settlement along the coast. However, it wasn't until the
            early 20th century, with the completion of the Panama Canal, that
            the city truly flourished, becoming known as 'the crossroads of the
            world'. <br /><br />
            Today, remnants of old Panama City can still be discovered. Amidst
            the modern skyline adorned with gleaming skyscrapers, you can stroll
            through the charming streets of Casco Viejo. Here, you'll find
            beautifully preserved colonial architecture, vibrant plazas, and
            quaint cafes serving local delicacies like ceviche and empanadas. As
            you explore, you'll see the fusion of history and modernity, with
            the majestic Pacific Ocean ever present on the horizon.
            <br /><br />
            In every corner of Panama City, the rich tapestry of its past blends
            seamlessly with the vibrant energy of the present. The city's
            diverse cultural influences are reflected in its music, festivals,
            and the warmth of its people. As you wander through its bustling
            streets, you'll experience a unique blend of old-world charm and
            contemporary flair. Whether you're marveling at the engineering
            marvel of the Panama Canal, savoring the flavors of Panamanian
            cuisine, or enjoying the lively nightlife, Panama City offers a
            captivating journey through time and tradition, all set against the
            backdrop of a stunning coastal landscape.
