          <h3>Why Panama?</h3>
          <h2>Panama, center of the world, heart of the universe.</h2>
          Legend has it that Panama City was founded by the Spanish
          conquistadors who saw its potential as a strategic hub for trade and
          exploration. Much like other historic capitals, Panama City started as
          a modest settlement along the coast. However, it wasn't until the
          early 20th century, with the completion of the Panama Canal, that the
          city truly flourished, becoming known as 'the crossroads of the
          world'. Today, remnants of old Panama City can still be discovered.
          Amidst the modern skyline adorned with gleaming skyscrapers, you can
          stroll through the charming streets of Casco Viejo. Here, you'll find
          beautifully preserved colonial architecture, vibrant plazas, and
          quaint cafes serving local delicacies like ceviche and empanadas. As
          you explore, you'll see the fusion of history and modernity, with the
          majestic Pacific Ocean ever present on the horizon.
